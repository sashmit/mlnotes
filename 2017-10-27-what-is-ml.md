Unsupervised learning - trying to uncover unobserved factors in the data.
	- no gold standard to judge against
    - hierachical clustering
    - PCA
    - factor analysis
    - kmeans
Early example: g-factor used to measure intrinstic intellgence in psycometric questions
  
Supervised learning - using collection of predictors and labeled data, build algo to predict outcome when not observed.
	- neural nets
    - random forsts
    - boosting
    - svms
Early example: Francis Galton create linear regression to predict heights.

Traditional stats vs ML:
ML - 
	- emphasis on predictions
    - eval by prediction performance
    - have cocern for overfitting but not model complexity usually
    - obtain generalizabiltiy through performance on unseen data
Tradtional stats:
	- empahsie superpopulation inference
    - focus on aprior hypotehsis
    - focus on simpler model over complex (parsimony) even if complex perform slightly better
    - emphaze paramater interpratability
    - having stat modeling or sampling assumptions to connet data to population of interest
